\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
Suppose a variable follows the continuous uniform distribution with a expected value $E(X)$ of 5 and uppper limit $b$ of 8.

\[ X \sim U(a,b)\]


\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What is the lower limit of the variable: $a$? 
\item What is the probability of an outcome less than 4? (i.e. $P(X\leq 4)$

% This is equivalent to the probability of an outcome between 2 and 4.
% so we let $L$ = 2 and $U$ = 4
%${4-2 \over 8 - 2} = {2 \over 6} = 1/3$

\item What is the variance of the variable $X$?
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
