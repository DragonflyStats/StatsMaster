\begin{enumerate}	
	\item  I throw a coin 10 times. Calculate the probability that 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I throw exactly 3 heads
	\item  I throw at least 2 heads
	\end{itemize}	

	
	\item 
	5. Prove the law of total probability, i.e. when $A1 , A2 , \ldots, An$ form a partition
	
	\[	P(B) = P(B|A1)P(A1) + P(B|A2)P(A2) + … + P(B|An)P(An)\]
	

	\item 
	2 components A and B.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item P(A) = event that A is working		P(A) = 0.98
		\item P(B) = event that B is working			P(B) = 0.95
		\item P(A and B) = event that both A and B are working = P(A) x P(B) = 0.98 x 0.95 = 0.931
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Solution: Lots of useless information.
	\item Complement event of at least one working is that they are both broken.
	\item Answer  100 – 4\% = 96\%
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{enumerate}
