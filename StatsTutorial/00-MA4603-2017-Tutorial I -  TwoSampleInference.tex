	\begin{itemize}
		\item The mean operating life for a random sample of $n = 10$ light bulbs is $\bar{x} = 4,000$ hours, with the sample
		standard deviation $s = 200$ hours. 
		
		\item The operating life of bulbs in general is assumed to be approximately normally distributed.
		\item We estimate the mean operating life for the population of bulbs from which this sample was taken, using a 95 percent confidence interval as follows:
		
		\[4,000\pm(2.262)(63.3)  = (3857,4143)\]
		
		\item The point estimate is 4,000 hours. The sample standard deviation is 200 hours, and the sample size is 10. Hence
		\[S.E(\bar{x} ) = { 200 \over \sqrt{10}} = 63.3\]

		\item In the report it was stated that the used confidence level was 99\% and the sample size was n = 25. 
		\item The industry standard for that type of analysis recommends the 95\% confidence level.
	\end{itemize}
	Question: Calculate a 95\% confidence interval
	%========================================================%
	\textbf{Solution:}
	
	The sample mean is 7.2
	
	\[X=\frac{8.1 + 6.3}{2}=7.2\]
	
	The sample size is n= 25. This is a small sample (i.e. less than 30)
	%========================================================%
	We are able to deduce the quantile of the $t-$distribution used to construct the 99\% confidence interval
	
	Confidence intervals are always 2 tailed , therefore k=2
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The significance level used is 1\%
		\item The degrees of freedom  is 24 (n-1)
		\item The significance level for the new interval is 5\%
	\end{itemize}
	%========================================================%
	Using Murdoch Barnes Table 7
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The quantile used to make the 99\% interval was 2.797.
		\item The quantile used to make the 95\% interval is 2.064.
	\end{itemize}
	We are now able to work out the standard error.
	%========================================================%
	
	
	\item \textbf{Single Sample Confidence interval for the Mean: Worked Example}\\
	
	The intelligence quotient (IQ) of 36 randomly chosen students was measured.
	Their average IQ was 109.9 with a variance of 324.
	The average IQ of the population as a whole is 100.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Calculate the p-value for the test of the hypothesis that on average
		students are as intelligent as the population as a whole against the alternative that on average students are more intelligent.
		
		
		\item Can we conclude at a significance level of 1\% that students are on average more intelligent than the population as a whole?
		
		\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the mean IQ of all students.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\begin{equation}
	Z_{Test} = \frac{X- \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{109.9 - 100}{\frac{18}{\sqrt{36}}} = \frac{9.9}{3} = 3.3
	\end{equation}
	
	
	\begin{equation}
	p.value = P(Z \geq Z_{Test}) = P(Z \geq 3.3) = 0.00048
	\end{equation}
	
	
	
	\begin{equation}
	\bar{X} \pm t_{1-\alpha/2,\nu}S.E.(\bar{X})
	\end{equation}
	$\nu = 1.96$
	\begin{equation}
	t_{1-\alpha/2,\nu} = 1.96
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
	109.9 \pm (1.96 \times 3) = [104.02, 115.79]
	\end{equation}
	
	
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Confidence Intervals for Proportions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item In a survey conducted by a mail order company a random sample of 200 customers yielded 172 who indicated that they 
	were highly satisfied with the delivery time of their orders. 
	
	\item Calculate an approximate 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of the company's customers who are 
	highly satisfied with delivery times.
\end{itemize}


\[p= \frac{172}{200}= 86\%\]


\[ \frac{p(100-p)}{n} =\frac{86 \times 14}{200}\]


%---------------------------------------------------------%

\noindent \textbf{CI for Difference in Two Means}
A research company is comparing computers from two different companies, X-Cel and Yellow, on the basis of energy consumption per hour. Given the following data, compute a $95\%$ confidence interval for the difference in energy consumption.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		Type & sample size & mean & variance \\ \hline
		X-cel & 17 & 5.353 & 2.743 \\ \hline
		Yellow & 17 & 3.882 & 2.985 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Remark: It is reasonable to believe that the variances of both groups is the same. Be mindful of this.


%---------------------------------------------------------%

\begin{itemize}
	\item Point estimate : $\bar{x} - \bar{y}$ = 1.469
	\item Standard Error: 0.5805
	\[ S.E.(\bar{x}-\bar{y}) = \sqrt{\frac{2.743}{17} + \frac{2.985}{17}} = \sqrt{0.33698} \]
	\item Quantile : 1.96 (Large sample, with confidence level of $95\%$.)
\end{itemize}

\[ 1.469  \pm (1.96 \times 0.5805) = (0.3321,2.607) \]


This analysis provides evidence that the mean consumption level per hour for X-cel is higher than the mean consumption level per hour for Yellow, and that the difference between means in the population is likely to be between 0.332 and 2.607 units.


%---------------------------------------------------------%


\noindent \textbf{Computing the Confidence Interval}
Standard Error for difference of two means (small aggregate sample)

\[ S.E.(\bar{x}-\bar{y}) = \sqrt{  s^2_p \left({1\over n_x}+{1\over n_y} \right)} \]

Pooled Variance $s^2_p$ is computed as:

\[ s^2_p = \frac{(n_x-1)s^2_x + (n_y-1)s^2_y}{(n_x-1) + (n_y-1)} \]

%---------------------------------------------------------%

\noindent \textbf{CI for Difference in Two Means}
From the previous example (comparing X-cel and Yellow) lets compute a 95\% confidence interval when the sample sizes are $n_x=10$ and $n_y=12$ respectively. (Lets assume the other values remain as they are.)
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		Type & sample size & mean & variance \\ \hline
		X-cel & 10 & 5.353 & 2.743 \\ \hline
		Yellow & 12 & 3.882 & 2.985 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The point estimate $\bar{x} - \bar{y}$ remains as 1.469. Also we require that both samples have equal variance. As both $X$ and $Y$ have variances at a similar level, we will assume equal variance.


%---------------------------------------------------------%


\noindent \textbf{Computing the Confidence Interval}
\begin{itemize} \item Pooled variance $s^2_p$ is computed as:
	
	\[ s^2_p = \frac{(10-1)2.743 + (12-1)2.985}{(10-1) + (12-1)}  = \frac{57.52}{20} = 2.87\]
	
	\item Standard error for difference of two means is therefore
	
	\[ S.E.(\bar{x}-\bar{y}) = \sqrt{  2.87 \left({1\over 10}+{1\over 12} \right)} = 0.726 \]
	
	\item The aggregate sample size is small i.e. 22. The degrees of freedom is $n_x+n_y-2 = 20$.
	From Murdoch Barnes tables 7, the quantile for a $95\%$ confidence interval is 2.086.
	
	\item The confidence interval is therefore
	\[ 1.469  \pm (2.086 \times 0.726) = 1.4699 \pm 1.514 =  (-0.044, 2.984 )  \]
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Confidence Interval Problem}

Suppose we want to estimate the average weight of an adult american male. We draw a random sample of 100 men from the population  and weigh them.\\ \vspace{0.3cm} We find that the average man in our sample weighs 180 pounds, and the standard deviation of the sample is 30 pounds.\\ What is the 95\% confidence interval?



\noindent  \textbf{Problem}

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	\textbf{Identify a sample statistic} - Since we are trying to estimate the mean weight in the population, we choose the mean weight in our sample (180) as the sample statistic.
	
	
	\item \textbf{Select a confidence level}  -In this case, the confidence level is defined for us in the problem. We are working with a 95\% confidence level.
	
	
	\item \textbf{Find the margin of error} - Previously, we described how to compute the margin of error.
\end{itemize}





Using these values, we can calculate the standard error with this expression.

\vspace{0.1cm}
\[
\mbox{Std. Error}(\bar{X})  = \sqrt{{30^2\over 100}} = \sqrt{9}
= 3\]

\vspace{0.1cm}

The Standard Error is 3lbs.



\noindent  \textbf{Outline of the Survey}
The objective of the survey is to obtain an assessment of the views or opinions of students studying in the Faculty of Business and Accounting studies at a specific university.

\vspace{0.4cm}

The Survey is broken into three parts - A,B and C. \\ \vspace{0.2cm}

A - Questions in this section are of ``Likert'' type. The data obtained here is ordinal (Categorical) although we treat it as if it were interval (Numerical) for the analysis.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
B - One question asking people to indicate what School they are from - nominal (Categorical) data.\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the point estimate of the proportion of the voters who will support the candidate in the election?
	\item Contruct and interpret a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of votes in the population that support the candidate.
	
	\item Given the confidennce interval, is the campaign manager justified in feeling confident that the candidate has at least 50\% support

\subsection{Example}
A random sample of 15 observations is taken from a normally distributed population
of values. The sample mean is 94.2 and the sample variance is 24.86.
Calculate a 99\% confidence interval for the population mean.


\noindent \textbf{Solution}
$t_(14,0.005) = 2.977$
99\% CI is $94.2 \pm 2.977 \sqrt{24.86/15}$ \\i.e. $94.2 \pm 3.83$ \\i.e. $(90.37,98.03)$

The catering manager in a hotel suspects that the weight of loaves of bread delivered
daily by a bakery is consistently below the nominal weight of 800g. To test this,
10 loaves chosen at random from a day’s deliveries are weighed. The mean and
standard deviation of the ten weights are 792g and 25g, respectively.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Carry out a formal significance test.

\subsection{ Single Sample Proportion Test - Worked Examples}
%% Question 2 part b

A study of 1000 randomly chosen adults indicated that 450 had been to the cinema at least once in the previous year.

A cinema wants to test the hypothesis that 50\% of all Irish adults have been to the cinema in the last year.

Calculate the p-value for such a test and draw the appropriate conclusion.

Discussion: Based on this sample, we estimate the proportion to be 0.45  (i.e. 45\%)

\[ \mbox{Point Estimate} \hat{p} = 0.45\]

\noindent \textbf{Step A : Formally state the null and alternative hypotheses}

\begin{itemize}
	\item p : true proportion of Irish adults who have been to the cinema in the last year.
	
	\item	Null Hypothesis               Ho:p = 0.50        True proportion is 50%
	
	\item Alternative Hypothesis      Ha:p 0.50        True proportion is not 50%.
	
	
	\item	N.B. This is a two-tailed procedure.
\end{itemize}




\noindent \textbf{Step B : Compute the test statistic.}

Remember the general structure of a test statistic

TS =Observed Value-Null ValueStd. Error 



From the formulae

We have to compute the standard error for a proportion. 

( From formulae at back of exam paper)

S.E.(p) =p(1-p)n=0.450.551000= 0.0157




\noindent \textbf{Step 3: Calculate p-value}

P-value is found from Murdoch Barnes Tables 3 ( Normal distribution)

Absolute value  |-3.18| =3.18




\[ \mbox{P-Value} = P(Z \geq 3.18) = 0.00074\]


\noindent \textbf{Step 4: Interpret the p-value to make a decision.}

The significance level is 5\%.  The procedure is a two tailed test.

	Suppose a machine produces circular parts for an electrical component. A random sample of 10 circular parts is selected and the variance of the sample is found to be 0.7 centimetres. The machine is producing the correct standard of circular parts if the variance of the diameter is no larger than 0.4cm.
	
	Suppose that the sampled measurements are normally distributed. A hypothesis test may be carried out to determine whether or not the machine is producing the correct standard of part.
	
	\begin{description}
		\item[$H_0$] $s^2=0.4$
		\item[$H_1$] $s^2>0.4$

	\begin{itemize}
		\item At a 5\% significance level, the critical value for the test is ? 2 9 ˜ 16.92 . 
		\item The test statistic is ? 2 = n - 1 s 2 s 2 
		\item H 0 = 10 - 1 × 0.7 0.4 = 15.75 .
