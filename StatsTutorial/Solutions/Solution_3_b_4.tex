An assembly plant has two suppliers, one based in England (E) and the other in Spain (S).  
60\% of the components are supplied by the Spanish factory and the remaining 40\% by the English base factory.  
The defect rate in the English plant is 5\% and in the Spanish plant is 6\%.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)]If a component is randomly selected from the production floor in Spain what is the probability that it will fail?
\item[(ii)]If a motherboard fails what is the probability that the component which caused the failure was sourced in England?
\end{itemize}

Did Motherboard Pass Quality Control Test?

Where was Motherboard manufactured?
\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent \textbf{Question:} \\ What is the probability that a randomly selected Motherboard fails the quality control test?\\

\noindent Compute P(F) 

\[P(F) = P(F \mbox{ and } E) + P(F\mbox{ and }S)\]


\noindent Re-arranging the conditional probability formula
\[P(F) = P(F|E)\times P(E) +  P(F|S)\times P(S) \]
\[P(F) = 0.05 \times 0.40 +  0.06 \times 0.60 \]
\[P(F) = 0.020  +  0.036 = \boldsymbol{0.056}
\]

\noindent \textbf{Question: Compute $P(C|F)$ }
\\ What is the probability that a randomly selected hard drive comes from cork, given that it fails the quality control test?

\[P(E|F) = \frac{P(F\mbox{ and }C)}{P(F)} = \frac{0.020}{0.056} = \boldsymbol{0.3571} \]
