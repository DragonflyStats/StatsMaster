\section{Question D01  - Poisson Example}
A motor dealership which specializes in agricultural machinery sells on vehicle every 2 days, on average

In this question the unit period is one day. The company expects to sell, on average, 0.5 vehicles every day.
The Poisson mean $m$ is therefore 0.5.

$P(X \geq 1)$

Go to your Poisson tables, and search for the $m=0.5$ column.
We are interested in the probability of \textbf{exactly} one vehicle sold on a particular day.
From the tables we can easily work out P($X \geq 1$), but this is probability of one or more vehicles being sold.
This is not the same thing.
\[P(X \geq 1) = P(X =1) + P( X=2) + P(X=3) + \ldots
P(X \geq 1) = P(X=1) + P(X \geq 2)\]
From tables
$P(X \geq 1)$
$P(X \geq 2)$

Six day working week?
our unit period is now six days.
How many vehicles do we expect to sell in 6 days?
answer = 3
$m=3$

P($X\geq 4$)

\begin{eqnarray}
e^{-6/5} = 0.3011942
e^{-4/5} = 0.449329
e^{-5/5} = 0.3678794
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What is the probability that the number of manuals sold will exceed 600?
\item What is the probability that the number of manuals sold will be less than 300?
\item What is the probability that the number of manuals sold will be between 450 and 550?
\item What is the minimum number of manuals that the company must print such
that that 90\% of the demand is satisfied?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 4 : Poisson Distribution}

Poisson mean for 1 hours: 16 per hour.

m = 16

Poisson mean for 30 minutes: 8 per 30 minutes.

m = 8

Poisson mean for 45 minutes: 12 per 45 minutes. 
m = 12
%===================================================================%

\subsection{Question 5 : Poisson Distribution}

Emission rate = 1.2 per minute

In the notes the Poisson mean is denoted $\lambda$ . However in the Murdoch Barnes tables it is denoted m.

$\lambda = 1.2$



%====================================================================%

\[P(X=0) = 1 - P(X\geq 1)\]

From tables $P(X \leq 1) = 0.699$


$P(X \leq 4) = 0.0338 $
