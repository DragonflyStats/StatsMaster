\item A pair of dice is thrown. Let X denote the minimum of the two numbers which occur.
Find the distributions and expected value of X.

\item A fair coin is tossed four times.
Let X denote the longest string of heads.
Find the distribution and expectation of X.
\item 
A fair coin is tossed until a head or five tails occurs.
Find the expected number E of tosses of the coin.

\item A coin is weighted so that $P(H) = 0.75$ and $P(T ) = 0.25$

The coin is tossed three times. Let X denote the number of
heads that appear.

\item 
A box contains two gold balls and three silver balls. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item You are allowed to choose
	successively balls from the box at random. 
	\item You win 1 dollar each time you
	draw a gold ball and lose 1 dollar each time you draw a silver ball. 
	\item After a
	draw, the ball is not replaced.
\end{itemize} Show that, if you draw until you are ahead by
1 dollar or until there are no more gold balls, this is a favorable game.
