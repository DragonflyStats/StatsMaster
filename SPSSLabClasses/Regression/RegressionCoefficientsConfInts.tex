\section{Inference for Regression Coefficients}
For each regression coefficient in a fitted model, we will perform the following hypothesis test on the corresponding parameter values $\beta_i$

\begin{framed}
	\begin{description}
		\item[ $H_0$] $\beta_i = 0 $
		\item[ $H_1$] $\beta_i \neq 0$
	\end{description}
\end{framed}
\begin{itemize}
\item If the regression coefficient is significant (indicated by a series of asterisks in the \texttt{R} summary), that means that corresponding predictor variable is useful in describing the response variable. If it is not significant - you can try a different model or a different combination of predictor variables (outside the scope of this course).

\item Even if an intercept regression coefficient is not significant, it is usually retained in the model (This will happen in the next example). There is a procedure called \textit{Regression Through the Origin}, where the intercept term is removed from the model. It is generally not advised to do this. Amongst other reasons, it is useful in exposing any flaws in the experimental procedure.

\subsection{Example}	
Consider the following experiment.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline Concentration  & 0 & 5 & 10 & 15 & 20 & 25 & 30 \\ \hline
	Absorbance &  0.003 &  0.127 & 0.251 & 0.390 & 0.498 & 0.625 & 0.763 \\ \hline
\end{tabular} 
\end{center} 

{
	\normalsize
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
# DO A FULL LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS ON THE DATA

>concentration=c(0,5,10,15,20,25,30)
>absorbance=c(0.03,0.127,0.251,0.390,0.498,0.625,0.763)
>regr=lm(absorbance~concentration)
# READ AS; ABSORBANCE DEPENDENT ON CONCENTRATION
>summary(regr)
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
}
This output from this code is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item You can be 95\% confident that the real, underlying value of the coefficient that you are estimating falls somewhere in that 95\% confidence interval. 
\item We can use confidence intervals as an alternative method of determining the outcome of hypothesis tests.

	\begin{description}
		\item[ $H_0$] $\beta_i = 0 $
		\item[ $H_1$] $\beta_i \neq 0$
	\end{description}

\item If the interval does not contain 0, we reject the null hypothesis. 
(this will coincide with the $p-$value being 0.05 or less.)
\item If the interval does contain 0, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
(this will coincide with the $p-$value greater than 0.05 )
\end{itemize}
