Question 4b  
Chi-square test for independence and Probability [10 Marks]

This question consists of two parts

Basic Probability
Chi Square Hypothesis test

Lets look at the table first

Important points from the table

1) There are 120 students , 60 male and 60 female

2) There are three programmes

1) Maths - with room for 30 students
2) Equine studies - with room for 30 students
3) Chemistry - with room for 60 students.

Let us assume that there a male and female student are equally likely to enter each program. (This is the null hypothesis).

We would expect the each program to have the following compositions.

1) Maths - would have 15 male and 15 female students (each year on average)
2) Equine studies - would have 15 male and 15 female students (each year on average)
3) Chemistry -would have 30 male and 30 female students (each year on average)

What is the probability that a randomly chosen person from the sample is an equine student?

There are 120 students altogether, 30 of those are equine science students.

\[P(Eq) = \frac{30}{120}= 0.25\]

Given that a student is female, what is the probability that that she is an equine science student.
\[P(Eq |F) = \frac{P(Eq \mbox{and} F)}{P(F)}= \frac{20/120}{60/120}= 0.33\]
