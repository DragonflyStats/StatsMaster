\subsection*{Assumptions}
The assumptions of multiple linear regression analysis are similar to those of the simple case involving only one independent variable. For point estimation, the principal assumptions are that
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(1)] the dependent variable is a random variable,
	\item[(2)] the relationship between the several independent variables and the one dependent variable is linear.
	Additional assumptions for statistical inference (estimation or hypothesis testing) are that
	\item[(3)] the variances of the conditional distributions of the dependent variable, given various combinations of values of the independent variables, are all equal,
	\item[(4)] the conditional distributions of the dependent variable
	are normally distributed, and
	\item[(5)] the observed values of the dependent variable are independent of each other. Violation of this assumption is called autocorrelation.
\end{itemize}
