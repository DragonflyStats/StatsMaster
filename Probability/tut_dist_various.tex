\begin{enumerate}

\item 
Find the probability of a "z" random variable being between -1.8 and 1.96?

\begin{framed}
Solution 
\begin{itemize}


\item Consider the complment event of being in this interval: a combination of being too low or two high. 

\item The probability of being too low for this interval is    (from before)

\item The probability of being too high for this interval is    (from before)

\item Therefore the probability of being outside the interval is  0.0359 + 0.0250 = 0.0609.

\item Therefore the probability of being inside the interval is 1- 0.0609 = 0.9391

  = 0.9391
\end{itemize}

\end{framed}



\end{enumerate}
