Tobit Regression

The Tobit model is a statistical model proposed by James Tobin (1958)[1] to describe the relationship between a non-negative dependent variable y_i and an independent variable (or vector) x_i. The term Tobit was derived from Tobin's name by truncating and adding -it by analogy with the probit model.[2]

The model supposes that there is a latent (i.e. unobservable) variable y_i^*. This variable linearly depends on x_i via a parameter (vector) \beta which determines the relationship between the independent variable (or vector) x_i and the latent variable y_i^* (just as in a linear model). In addition, there is a normally distributed error term u_i to capture random influences on this relationship. The observable variable y_i is defined to be equal to the latent variable whenever the latent variable is above zero and zero otherwise.

y_i = \begin{cases} 
    y_i^* & \textrm{if} \; y_i^* >0 \\ 
    0     & \textrm{if} \; y_i^* \leq 0
\end{cases}
where y_i^* is a latent variable:

 y_i^* = \beta x_i + u_i, u_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2) \,

The tobit model, also called a censored regression model, is designed to estimate 
linear relationships between variables when there is either left- or right-censoring in 
the dependent variable (also known as censoring from below and above, respectively). 

Censoring from above takes place when cases with a value at or above some threshold, all 
take on the value of that threshold, so that the true value might be equal to 
the threshold, but it might also be higher. In the case of censoring from 
below, values those that fall at or below some threshold are censored.
