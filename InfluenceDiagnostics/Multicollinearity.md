Multicollinearity 
============================================
Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent in the model are 
highly correlated and, as a consequence, provide redundant information 
about the response when placed together in a model. 
 
(Everyday examples of multicollinear independent variables are height 
and weight of a person, years of education and income, and assessed 
value and square footage of a home.)
