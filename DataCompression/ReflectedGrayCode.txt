The reflected binary code, also known as Gray code after Frank Gray, is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

The reflected binary code was originally designed to prevent spurious output from electromechanical switches. Today, Gray codes are widely used to facilitate error correction in digital communications such as digital terrestrial television and some cable TV systems.

Name

Bell Labs researcher Frank Gray introduced the term reflected binary code in his 1947 patent application, remarking that the code had "as yet no recognized name".[1] He derived the name from the fact that it "may be built up from the conventional binary code by a sort of reflection process".
