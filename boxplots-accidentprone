3: IQR
The third feature is the variation/dispersion around the median. The IQR is the middle 50\% of the data. When you are dealing with skewed data, the IQR is the most reliable measure of variation. Outliers affect the mean, making it an unrealistic measure of centrality (for symmetric data).

The most common use of box plots is for comparing two data sets on the same scale. 

For now, it is important that you are clear what a box-plot tells you about a distribution of data and what measure of centrality and variability are most appropriate based on the distribution.

 

Example
Accident Prone Ltd has recorded the following data. It shows a record of the ages of the people involved in accidents over a three month period.

You are required to construct a box-plot for this data and to summarise your findings in a brief report.

Remarks  
The sample size (n) is 40
The data is already in ascending order
The minimum and maximum are 16 and 64 respectively. The Range is therefore 48.

The median is the average of the 20th (which is 31) and 21st value (which is 32): i.e. 31.5

The lower quartile (Q1) is the average of the 10th and 11th values 21.5

The upper quartile (Q3) is the average of the 30th and 31st values 37.5

The IQR is therefore 16

The lower fence is computed as 
\[21.5 - 1.5 \times 16 = 21.5 -24 = -2.5\] 

It makes no sense to use -2.5, so we will use 0 as the value for our lower fence

The upper fence is computed as

\[37.5 + 1.5 \times 16 = 37.5 + 24 = 61.5\]
