The surface finish of a metal part is thought to be linearly related to the cutting speed of the machine which produces it.  Surface finish is measured on an arbitrary scale from 0 to 20, with 0 being the roughest finish.  The following data have been observed:

\begin{verbatim}
Surface finish (Y)4.895.956.326.007.709.509.739.50
Speed (RPM) (X)1213141516171819
\end{verbatim}


\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)]Draw a scatter diagram to illustrate the data
	\item[(ii)]Find the value of the correlation coefficient
	\item[(iii)]Using a significance level of  = 0.05, test the claim that there is no linear correlation between surface finish and speed
	\item[(iv)]Find the equation of the regression line and plot the regression line on the scatter diagram
	\item[(v)]Estimate the surface finish if the machine speed is set at 17rpm. 
\end{itemize}
